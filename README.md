# No Boring Selfies - Demo App

This is a Demo App for the [React Native Image Selfie Segmentation](https://github.com/tomzweb/react-native-image-selfie-segmentation/) 
module, which in turn implements
[**MLKit Vision** Selfie Segmentation](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/selfie-segmentation) 
to combine a selfie and background image in React Native.

It takes a selfie and a selection of images and combines them. 
You can then scroll through, filter backgrounds by type, and save the image to your image gallery.

The app was built using:

* [react-native-image-selfie-segmentation](https://github.com/tomzweb/react-native-image-selfie-segmentation/)
* [@react-native-community/cameraroll](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll)
* [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker)
* [@react-navigation/native](https://reactnavigation.org/)
